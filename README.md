# Project-Recipe-App

In this project, We will build a Recipe tracking app. The app will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button. 

* App will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (edit and delete).
* Create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
* It does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
* Add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.
